### Welcome to Handler Error

Error management is one of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of software development. When errors are poorly managed, they can lead to hours of debugging, missed deadlines, and frustrated users. This is where **Handler Error** steps in.

Handler Error is a robust library designed to simplify error handling by providing:

- **Rich Contextual Information**: Understand not just what went wrong, but also where, why, and how to fix it.
- **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: Seamless integration with both Node.js and modern browsers.
- **Customizable Solutions**: Tailor error messages and behaviors to your application's needs.

Whether you're building a small utility or a complex application, Handler Error equips you with the tools you need to write clearer, more actionable error messages and streamline debugging for you and your team.

### Why Choose Handler Error?

- **Clarity for Developers**: Designed with best practices for creating error messages that empower developers.
- **Ease of Integration**: A lightweight library that can be added to any JavaScript or TypeScript project with minimal setup.
- **Debugging Made Simple**: Includes built-in methods for logging errors, fetching runtime details, and converting errors into structured JSON for external integrations.

Imagine this: instead of cryptic error messages like `TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined`, you get detailed output with actionable solutions, context, and even examples of what went wrong and how to fix it.
